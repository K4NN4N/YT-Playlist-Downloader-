   chmod +x youtube-playlist-downloader.sh
   ```

### Termux-Specific Setup

If you're using Termux on Android, follow these additional steps:

   ```
   pkg update && pkg upgrade
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pkg install python ffmpeg
   ```

3. Install yt-dlp using pip:
   ```
   pip install yt-dlp
   ```

4. Grant storage permission to Termux (if not already granted):
   ```
   termux-setup-storage
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```
   ./youtube-playlist-downloader.sh
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your desired options:
   - Choose between K4NN4N's Choice (default settings) or custom options
   - Enter the YouTube playlist URL when prompted
   - Monitor the download progress
   - Choose post-download options (retry failed downloads, check for updates, or exit)

## Options

- **K4NN4N's Choice**: Uses default settings optimized for high-quality audio (320K mp3 with embedded thumbnails).
- **Custom Options**: Allows you to set:
  - Download directory
  - Audio quality (320K, 256K, 192K, 128K, 96K)
  - Audio format (mp3, aac, flac, m4a, opus, vorbis)
  - Thumbnail saving
  - Download order (normal or reverse)

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter the error "yt-dlp: command not found", the script will provide instructions on how to install yt-dlp. Follow the provided instructions to install yt-dlp on your system.
- For Termux users, ensure you've granted storage permissions to Termux if you're having issues accessing the download directory.
- If you're using Windows, make sure you're running the script in a Unix-like environment such as Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to the download directory.
